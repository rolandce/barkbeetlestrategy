For this interactive bivariate map, I decided to depict the locations of activities to implement the Western Bark Beetle Strategy in Montana according to county. To do this, I collected my Bark Beetle Site point data and Montana County polygon data from the US Forest Serive and the Montana Data Portal. I first converted the points to a geojson using geojson.io. I then clipped the data to only show points within the state of Montana using QGIS. For the polygons with the County data, I opened the data in geojson.io and added the number of sites in the table for each polygon, then converted it to a geojson. I obtained my basemap from leaflet providers. Additionally, the major functions of this map includes the bind pop ups for each site, depicting the adminstrative boundaries, and the point to layer function which sets the beetle shaped point icons. I added a legend showing the number of strategy sites per county and what the beetle icon stands for. I also added a title and description box using commands I learned previously. I used Lora, Serif for the font of this map.
